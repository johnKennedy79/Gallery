# Gallery

🐿️ I want to browse a set of thumbnail images that load quickly
🐿️ I want to select a thumbnail and display a larger version of the image, with a description
🐿️ I expect accessible considerations like alternative text for images, and the ability to click next and previous buttons using the keyboard.

goals completed
set thumbnails hid the overflow and set it to scroll this works well on smaller touch screen devices. thumb nails also inlarge on hover.

you can select the next and previous buttons by using left and right arrow keys or you can tab through the thumb nails and select with the spacebar.

screen reader reads the alt text on thumbnails but doesn't automaticaly do it on the main image when you click next or previouse you need to click on the main image or tab accross and press space bar.

the next and previouse buttons go through the thumbnail array in a circular loop.
